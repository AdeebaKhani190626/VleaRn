# VleaRn

# Objective:
Our basic aim is to provide users a platform to conduct online learning sessions which are engaging and interactive in an environment more closely resembling to on campus classroom. Moreover, we want to bring virtual reality in the field of education especially in Pakistan as it has no such technology and the platform it uses is google meet and zoom.
